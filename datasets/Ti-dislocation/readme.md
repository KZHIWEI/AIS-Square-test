## Introduction

This is the dataset of Ti's DFT data for training DeepMD model.

## Generation Approach

The concurrent learning procedure called deep potential generator (DP-GEN) [1, 2] is applied to perform iterations in order to refine the DP model. We set up 32 iterations in the DP-GEN workflow. For each iteration, a set of initial configurations are chosen from the α-Sn, β-Sn, bct-Sn and bcc-Sn structures. Next, five temperatures are chosen for each iteration and the temperatures arise after every 8 iterations. In total, 20 temperatures ranging from 50 to 1950 K with the interval being 100 K are set. For each temperature, nine different pressures including 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, and 50 GPa are set. Detailed setups of the exploration strategy are listed in Table S1 of SI. Finally, three steps, i.e., the exploration, labeling, and training processes are performed in each iteration to generate a new DP model.

**DFT method:** We perform DFT calculations for Sn with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4.4) [3]. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [4, 5] is used to describe the ion-electron interactions with 14 valence electrons for Sn. We utilize the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) exchange-correlation functional [6]. The kinetic energy cutoff is set to 650 eV. The Gaussian smearing of 0.20 eV is chosen with the smallest allowed spacing between the Monkhorstpack (MP) [7] k-points set as 0.10 $Å^{−1}$ to sample the first Brillouin zone of solid structures. The total energy is converged to be less than $10^{−6}$ eV in self-consistent electronic iterations.

## Data Format

The directory tree is as follows:

```
Ti_training_data
-- omega
-- Ti_0722
```

The Ti_0722 folder contains Ti's DFT result sampled by DPGEN and organized in DeepMD format.

A pbc unit system usually has the following substructure:

```
-- system
-- -- type_map.raw
-- -- type.raw
-- -- set.000/box.npy
-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
-- -- set.000/force.npy
-- -- set.000/virial.npy
```
