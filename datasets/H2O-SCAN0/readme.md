## Introduction

This dataset cnontains DFT samples in DeepMD format used in [1], for ferroelectric $\alpha-In_2Se_3$.

## Generation Approach

To construct an accurate and transferable SCAN0 path-integral deep potential model with a minimal number of the expensive SCAN0 DFT data, an active machine learning procedure called deep potential generator (DP-GEN) [2] was adopted. Considering that the molecular configurations predicted by SCAN and SCAN0 are close to each other, 900 configurations were uniformly extracted from the 64-molecule 11 ps SCAN PI-AIMD trajectory reported in ref [3]. The total potential energy E and ionic forces Fi of each atom i of these configurations were calculated by using Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)[4] with the SCAN0 XC functional. The Hamann− Schlüter−Chiang−Vanderbilt (HSCV) pseudopotentials [5,6] with an energy cutoff of 150 Ry were employed. The obtained E and Fi together with atomic positions were adopted as the initial training data.



## Data Format

The directory tree is as follows:

```
202204001
-- data_scan0
-- PseudoPogtential
```

Subdirectory of data_scan0 contains unit systems in DeePMD format.

A pbc unit system usually has the following substructure:

```
-- system
-- -- type_map.raw
-- -- type.raw
-- -- set.000/box.npy
-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
-- -- set.000/force.npy
-- -- set.000/virial.npy
```
