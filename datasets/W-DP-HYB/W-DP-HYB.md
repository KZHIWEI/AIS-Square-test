## Introduction

This is the dataset of Tungsten DFT data for training DeepMD model.

## Generation Approach

This data set is generated with DPGEN [2,3],  a concurrent learning scheme that generates the DP training dataset iteratively.

**Initial dataset.** The initial dataset is composed of three parts:

1. The equilibriated unit cells of the BCC, the FCC, the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) and diamond structures. 

2. Artificially strained and perturbed structures. Hydrostatic strain is applied to equilibriated structures by changing lattice parameters ranging from 96% to 106% at a step 2%. Perturbations are then exerted on each structure under strain. The atom positions are randomly perturbed with a maximal displacement of 0.01 Å. The cell is randomly perturbed by 3%. 
3. AIMD trajectory of the deformed structures. Setting each compressed structure under perturbation as initial configuration, AIMD simulations are conducted with 5 steps under temperature 100K.

All the data are labeled with DFT calculations (see part c. Labeling for more details). In other words, the DFT-calculated energy, atomic forces and virial tensor of each structure are recorded.

**Exploration.** The LAMMPS package [4] compiled with the DeePMD-kit [5] support is employed to perform DPMD simulations for exploration of the configuration space.  The exploration uses 4 subsets of configurations as the initial configurations for the MD sampling. The initial configurations, simulation ensemble, temperatures and pressures conditions are summarized in the following and in the Table I of [1].

1. The strained and perturbed 2 × 2 × 2 supercell BCC W bulk. NPT ensemble. Temperature 50 to 5100 K. Pressure −2 to 5 GPa. 
2. The strained and perturbed 3 × 3 × 3 supercell BCC W bulk. NPT ensemble. Temperature 50 to 5100 K. Pressure −2 to 5 GPa. 
3. (111),(110) and (112) free surfaces. NVT ensemble. Temperature 300 to 1800K. 4. Locally perturbed 2 × 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 × 3 supercells of BCC W bulk. NVE ensemble.

During the exploration, the deviation of force predictions of four DP models, trained with identical hyper-parameters but different random seeds, is used to estimate the error in the force prediction. If the maximal deviation of atomic forces is higher than 0.20 eV/Å but lower than 0.35 eV/Å, the configuration is considered as a candidate configuration and sent for labeling.

**Labeling.** The labels of the candidate configurations, i.e. the energy, force, and virial tensor, are computed by DFT with exchange-correlation modeled by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) [8]. The DFT calculations were conducted using VASP[6, 7] package. The Brillouin zone is sampled by the Monkhorst-Pack method with a grid spacing of 0.16 $Å^{−1}$ . The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method [9, 10] is used and the energy cut-off of the plane-wave basis set is set to 600 eV. The 6s and 5d electrons are considered valence electrons. The convergence criterion for the self-consistent field iteration is set to $10^{−6}$ eV. The same DFT parameters are also used for labeling the initial dataset.

**Training.** In each iteration, four models are trained simultaneously using the same dataset and hyper-parameters, with the only difference being the random seeds employed to initialize the model parameters. The sizes of the hidden layers of the two-body embedding nets G(2) are (20, 40, 80), while the three-body embedding G(3) has hidden layers of sizes (4, 8, 16). The hidden layers of the fitting nets are set to (240, 240, 240). The Adam stochastic gradient descent method[11] with the default hyper-parameter settings provided by the TensorFlow package [12] is used to train the DP models. The learning rate is exponentially decayed with starting and final learning rates set to $1 × 10^{−3}$ and $5 × 10^{−8}$ , respectively. In each DP-GEN iteration the DP model is trained with 4 × 105 steps. After the DP-GEN iterations converge, the productive models are trained with $2.4 × 10^{7}$ steps. The size of the DNNs used in the DP models, and other hyper-parameters are provided in the Supplementary Material Table SI.

**Refinement.** The productive DP models are firstly refined with DFT labeled structures of SIA structures, the γ-line and (100) surface structure. SIA data is generated via additional DP-GEN iterations, with three types of SIA structures (namely h111i,h110i and h100i dumbbells) as initial configurations, the explored temperature ranges from 50K to 600K. γ-line structures are obtained directly from the DFT γ-line calculation along h111i directions on {110} and {112} planes. We also included relaxed and unrelaxed (100) free surface data in the refining dataset. The refined models are trained for $1 × 10^6$ steps with model parameters initialized by the productive model. The starting learning rate is set to 1 × 10−4 , and the starting prefactors of energy, force and virial tensors, p start ,p start f ,p start ξ are set to 1.0, 1.0 and 0.9, respectively (See the Supplementary Material for the definition of the prefactors). The other hyper-parameters are the same as those used to train the productive model. Then, the DP models are further refined by the isolated W atom energy. All the hyper-parameters are the same with those used in the first refinement except that the number of training steps is set to $4 × 10^6$ . The energy of an isolated atom is calculated with spin-polarized DFT. Benchmark results are based on the model after the refinements.

## Data Format

The directory tree is as follows:

```
Wdata
-- init
```

The init folder contains Tungsten's DFT result sampled by DPGEN and organized in DeepMD format.

A pbc unit system usually has the following substructure:

```

-- -- set.000/coord.npy
-- -- set.000/energy.npy
